All extracted source files have the same modification date of 1999-05-13
The same applies to the files in apps, docu and gadgets.arc

source1 includes 121, source2 126 and source3 81 *.Mod files, a total of 328 *.Mod files.
Kernel and compiler source code is apparently missing.

Modification steps:
- Converted all *.Mod files to plain text UTF-8 format, where the Oberon character set was translated to regular ISO 8859-1
- Initial git commit
