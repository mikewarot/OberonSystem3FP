All extracted source files have the same modification date of 1999-05-13
The same applies to the files in apps, docu and gadgets.arc

source1 includes 121, source2 126 and source3 81 *.Mod files, a total of 328 *.Mod files.
Kernel and compiler source code is apparently missing.

Modification steps:
- Converted all *.Mod files to plain text UTF-8 format, where the Oberon character set was translated to regular ISO 8859-1
- Initial git commit
- Added minimal Kernel.Mod and Modules.Mod to satisfy dependencies
- Corrected syntax issues
  removed incompatible syntax like '-' proc name prefix or marker characters (range ASCII 1 .. 10) or '!', or '*' after ARRAY, or typename after END
  commented out CODE sections
  removed unused modules with language extensions: Adaptec7/Script, MathH
- Removed unused modules depending on the compiler: Browser, Builder, Watson0, Watson
- Removed redundant modules: Empty.CD, Mitsumi.CD, GD54xx.Display, W32.Display, VGA.Display, S3C924.Display, S3Trio.Display,

- Replaced SYSTEM.HALT by HALT; SYSTEM.BYTE by BYTE; "SYSTEM.VAL(SET," by "BITS("; "SYSTEM.VAL(LONGINT," by "ORD("; SYSTEM.VAL(CHAR, by "(";
  "SYSTEM.VAL(SHORTINT," by "("; "SYSTEM.VAL(INTEGER," by "("
